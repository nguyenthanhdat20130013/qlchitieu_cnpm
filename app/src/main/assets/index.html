                <p>Tracking money is a fairly straightforward process – you just have to write down everything you spend. But if you have ever tried to do it before, you know that it can be very frustrating with the wrong tools. The more difficult it is to enter a transaction, the less likely you are to actually do it! Monefy understands this and has simplified the process for entering transactions to make it quick, easy, and (relatively) painless. So, next time you buy coffee or take a taxi, fill in the expense amount and hit “Add”. That’s it! One click and done. Tracking your money has never been so quick and easy.</p>
